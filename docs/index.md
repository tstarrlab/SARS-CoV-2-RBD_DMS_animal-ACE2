## Overview 

We performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact of all single amino-acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variant RBDs on binding affinity for relevant animal ACE2s. We measured binding affinity (log10Ka,app) for ACE2s from white-tailed deer, Syrian hamste,r little brown bat, and cat.

Here, we link to an interactive visualization that enables exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans.


### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the change in animal ACE2-binding caused by mutations in each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps.md %}).


### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the APN-binding phenotypes from each experiment [here](https://github.com/tstarrlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS_animal-ACE2/tree/main/results/final_variant_scores).
