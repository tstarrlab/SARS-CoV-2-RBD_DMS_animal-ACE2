## Overview 

We performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact on APN binding of all single amino-acid mutations in the Porcine Delta-CoV RBD. We measured binding affinity (log10Ka) for the galline APN ortholog. For human and porcine APN, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each variant at 1uM ligand.

Here, we link to two interactive visualizations that enable exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans.


### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the change in APN-binding caused by mutations in each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps.md %}).


### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the APN-binding phenotypes from each experiment [here](https://github.com/tstarrlab/PD-CoV-RBD_DMS/tree/main/results/final_variant_scores).
